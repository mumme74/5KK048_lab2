# Explicit type conversion (task j (II))
The word explict means that something is clearly expressed, as opposed to implicit which is more "read between the lines".
Therefore explicit type conversion means that you clearly express what type you want a variable to be.

example:
```python3
# implict type
three = 3.0 # will implicitly get float type

# explicit type
pi = float("3.14159265") # explicitly stating that pi variable is float type
```
